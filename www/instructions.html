                Welcome to the <a href="http://azgs.arizona.edu/">Arizona State Geological Survey's</a> map download tool. This tool will allow you to select any of our published GIS datasets. 
        </p>
        <p>
                All of our published gisdata currently follow the United State Geological Survey's <a href="https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/">Geologic Map Schema</a> (GeMS). The GeMs schema recommends releasing data in the proprietary ESRI File Geodatabase format (.gdb), which you can download by selecting ESRI File Geodatabase in the format dropdown menu.
        </p>
        <p>
                We also provide simplified versions of these geodatabases in the popular <a href="http://switchfromshapefile.org">ESRI Shapefile</a>, geojson, and KML formats. These simplified versions only contain polygons of the geologic units, contacts, faults, orientaton points, and the unit descriptions. We recommend this simplified version for most users.
        </p>
        <p>
                The tool will provide you with limited metadata for your selected map (i.e., the year of publication and the map authors), but you can find the full metadata record for the map by following the link to the Arizona Geological Survey document repository that will appear when you select a map.
